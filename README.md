✨ It all started when I got laid-off 📉 from my job 👔  at the beginning of the pandemic 🦠, 
one of the engineers 👨🏾‍💻  told me I should consider software engineering because I’m sharp 🔪 and have good communication skills 📡. 

So I began learning JavaScript and after a month I felt confident enough to try my first Leetcode easy problem. I was hooked🪝 I knew this was the right path for me. I used my Irish heritage 🇮🇪  to find a mentor👨🏼‍🦳 who recommended attending a Coding Bootcamp to jump-start my career. His advice led me to enroll in Hack Reactor ☢️ where I was able to strengthen 🏋🏻‍♂️  my engineering and interpersonal skills. Now I want to use my skills to solve interesting problems and make the world 🌍  a better place  📈.🚀


Skills: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React, React Native, jQuery, Node.js, Express, SQL, No-SQL and Go
